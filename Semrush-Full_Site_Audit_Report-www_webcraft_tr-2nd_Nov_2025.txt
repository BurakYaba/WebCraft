ERRORS 33 -4

22 hreflang conflicts within page source code
About this issue: If you're running a multilingual website, it is necessary to help users from 22 -2

other countries find your content in the language that is most appropriate for them. This is
where the hreflang (rel="alternate" hreflang="x") attribute comes in handy. This attribute
helps search engines understand which page should be shown to visitors based on their
location.
It is very important to properly synchronize your hreflang attributes within your page's
source code, otherwise you may experience unexpected search engine behavior. For more
information, see this article https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/189077?hl=en.
How to fix: To avoid any conflicts, we recommend that you review your hreflang attributes
within your page's source code and fix any of the following issues: 1.
Conflicting hreflang and rel=canonical URLs. 2. Conflicting hreflang URLs.
3. No self-referencing hreflang URLs.

11 incorrect pages found in sitemap.xml
About this issue: A sitemap.xml file makes it easier for crawlers to discover the pages on 11 -1

your website. Only good pages intended for your visitors should be included in your
sitemap.xml file. This error is triggered if your sitemap.xml contains URLs that: 1.
lead to webpages with the same content. 2. redirect to a different webpage.
3. return non-200 status code. Populating your file with such URLs will confuse search
engines, cause unnecessary crawling or may even result in your sitemap being rejected.
How to fix: Review your sitemap.xml for any redirected, non-canonical or non-200 URLs.
Provide the final destination URLs that are canonical and return a 200 status code.

WARNINGS 38 0

18 pages have low text-HTML ratio
About this issue: Your text to HTML ratio indicates the amount of actual text you have on 18 -1

your webpage compared to the amount of code. This issue is triggered when your text to
HTML is 10% or less. Search engines have begun focusing on pages that contain more
content.
That's why a higher text to HTML ratio means your page has a better chance of getting a
good position in search results. Less code increases your page's load speed and also helps
your rankings. It also helps search engine robots crawl your website faster.
How to fix: Split your webpage's text content and code into separate files and compare their
size. If the size of your code file exceeds the size of the text file, review your page's HTML
code and consider optimizing its structure and removing embedded scripts and styles.

16 pages have too much text within the title tags
About this issue: Most search engines truncate titles containing more than 70 characters. 16 0

Incomplete and shortened titles look unappealing to users and won't entice them to click on
your page. For more information, please see this Google article:
https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35624.
How to fix: Try to rewrite your page titles to be 70 characters or less.

3 pages have a low word count
About this issue: This issue is triggered if the number of words on your webpage is less than 3 0

200. The amount of text placed on your webpage is a quality signal to search engines.
Search engines prefer to provide as much information to users as possible, so pages with
longer content tend to be placed higher in search results, as opposed to those with lower
word counts.
For more information, please view this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3-
obcXkyA4. How to fix: Improve your on-page content and be sure to include more than 200
meaningful words.

1 page doesn't have an h1 heading
About this issue: While less important than <title> tags, h1 headings still help define your 1 +1

page’s topic for search engines and users. If an <h1> tag is empty or missing, search engines
may place your page lower than they would otherwise. Besides, a lack of an <h1> tag breaks
your page’s heading hierarchy, which is not SEO friendly.
How to fix: Provide a concise, relevant h1 heading for each of your page.

NOTICES 7 0

6 pages have only one incoming internal link
About this issue: Having few incoming internal links means little to no visits or chances of 6 0

being placed in search results. AI search engines use internal linking patterns to understand
content importance and relationships within your site's knowledge network. Pages with few
internal links may look less authoritative to AI algorithms and reduce your content's visibility
and citation potential.
How to fix: Add more incoming internal links to pages with important content.

Llms.txt not found
About this issue: The llms.txt file helps AI search engines better understand your website's 1 0

content by providing LLM-friendly information. This file offers a short summary, guidance,
and links to other useful resources. How to fix: 1.
Create an llms.txt file. 2. Place it in your website's root directory and ensure the file is
accessible.
3. Refer to llmstxt.org for examples and tips on how to properly create and manage it.

Low word count
About this issue: This issue is triggered if the number of words on your webpage is less than 200. The amount of text
placed on your webpage is a quality signal to search engines. Search engines prefer to provide as much information to
users as possible, so pages with longer content tend to be placed higher in search results, as opposed to those with lower
word counts. For more information, please view this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3-obcXkyA4. How to fix:
Improve your on-page content and be sure to include more than 200 meaningful words.

Missing h1
About this issue: While less important than <title> tags, h1 headings still help define your page’s topic for search engines
and users. If an <h1> tag is empty or missing, search engines may place your page lower than they would otherwise.
Besides, a lack of an <h1> tag breaks your page’s heading hierarchy, which is not SEO friendly. How to fix: Provide a
concise, relevant h1 heading for each of your page.

Pages with only one internal link
About this issue: Having few incoming internal links means little to no visits or chances of being placed in search results. AI
search engines use internal linking patterns to understand content importance and relationships within your site's
knowledge network. Pages with few internal links may look less authoritative to AI algorithms and reduce your content's
visibility and citation potential. How to fix: Add more incoming internal links to pages with important content.
